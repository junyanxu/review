\section{Real Data Calibration}

\subsection{LMM}
To calibrate LMM, we need two kinds of data: volatility and correlation of forward rate. 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\color{red} Caps are for calculating volatility (sum of individual vol)}
\item {\color{red} Swaptions are for calulating volatility and correlation (average of forward rate)}
\item Correlation can also be derived from historical analysis
\end{itemize}

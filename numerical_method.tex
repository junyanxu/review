\subsection{Tree Method}
\subsubsection{Binary Tree Method}
To price the American option, we can use tree method (Binomial/Trinomial). Suppose the we have $\sigma$, $r$, $\delta t$, $P_{+}$, $P_{-}$. The we have $u = e^{\sigma\sqrt{\delta t}}$, $d = e^{-\sigma\sqrt{\delta t}}$ as multiplication factors. We can have 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
P^+ &= \frac{e^{r\delta t} - d }{u-d} \\
P^- &= \frac{u - e^{r\delta t} }{u-d} 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
To summarize the method
\begin{enumerate}
\item Time complexity $O(n^2)$
\item Good risk neutral interpretation
\item Need to choose small enough $\delta t$ to make the P positive (not flexible enough)
\item the range of $dS$ is determined by $\delta t$ (hard to select $\delta t$)
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Trinomial Tree Method}

\subsection{Acceptance Rejection}
For a distribution which only has pdf but no cdf, we can get a distribution with cdf and pdf $g(v)$ generated by $F^{-1}(u)$ with u from $[0, 1]$. {\color{blue} (We need to know F(x) is uniform distribution for x belongs to 
any distribution. Since quantile by definition is uniform distributed)}

We get a big number M to accept y generated by $g(y)$ and $v$ from uniform if 
$$
	v <= \frac{f(y)}{Mg(y)}
$$ 
This can be thought of as we generate density g(y) and only accept those density weighted by possibility $f(y)$.

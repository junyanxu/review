\section{Important Algorithm}

Before the solution, here are some summary of common graph algorithms

\subsection{A Star Algorithm}

The key idea is to always get minimum

\begin{equation}
  k(n) = g(n) + f(n)
\end{equation}

as searching start

If $f(n) \leq \tilde{f}(n)$, then the $f(n)$ is admissive, and the searching result is guaranteed to be smallest. Dijstra is a special case for A* algorithm where $f(n) = 0$

Use a tree set as a priority queue for getting next.
